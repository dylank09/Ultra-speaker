# Ultra-speaker
I am currently building a system that detects if a person is walking away or coming back using ultrasound sensors and using this information, when a person goes away from the sensor (i.e. the speaker) the volume of the speaker will decrease and when the person comes back, the volume of the speaker will return to normal.
